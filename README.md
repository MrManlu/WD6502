# WD6502
Prototyping SBC based on W65C02 CPU

![WD6502-PDB-front](img/WD6502.png)


## Why?
This is a minimal CPU<->RAM<->ROM interconnection to achieve a fast breadboard prototyping, minimizing bad connections occurred when connecting several jumper wires.

There is no fixed memory map. Freedom for everyone! There exists a half-sized breadboard in the upper-right zone of the PCB to create the address decoding circuit. Also, there exists a lower full-sized breadboard to connect peripherals: VIAs, ACIAs, SD card breakout boards,...
